# Modda

Automates the installation of a bunch of mods above an Infinity Engine based game.
(though so far, it was only tested with BG1 & BG2).

## Initial goal

Be able to generate (mostly) reproducible installations

## Operation

You create a recipe that 
 - decides which language(s) will be selected
 - lists all mods that should be installed, in order, and of the components for each mod

The recipe is a YAML file (This could probably be a json file, but this was not tested), for example this is for an installation on BG1 with a preference for french and fallback on english.

```yaml
lang_dir: "fr_FR"
lang_preferences: ["#rx#^fran[cÃ§]ais", french, english, "american english"]
modules:
  - name: DlcMerger
    components: [
      1 # Merge DLC into game -> Merge "Siege of Dragonspear" 
    ]
  - name: bg1ub
    components: [
      0,  # Ice Island Level Two Restoration
      11, # Scar and the Sashenstar's Daughter
      12, # Quoningar, the Cleric
      13, # Shilo Chen and the Ogre-Magi
      14, # Edie, the Merchant League Applicant
      16, # Creature Corrections
      17, # Creature Restorations
      18, # Creature Name Restorations
      19, # Minor Dialogue Restorations
      21, # Store, Tavern and Inn Fixes and Restorations
      22, # Item Corrections and Restorations
      29, # Duke Eltan in the Harbor Master's Building
      30, # Nim Furlwing Encounter
      32, # Svlast, the Fallen Paladin Encounter
      33, # Mal-Kalen, the Ulcaster Ghost
      34  # Chapter 6 Dialogue Restorations
    ]
```

The comments are optional of course, they are only for the reader.

## Limitations

- Needs weidu accessible on the path
- Only tested with weidu 247
- At this point, was only tested on linux
- Mods that use ACTION_READLN are not handled well (installation is interrupted until the user makes some choice, and reproductibility is not guaranteed) 

## Todo

- Implement HTTP fetching of mods
- Warn if the version of a mod changed ; this may impact reproductibility (component number changing, new components etc.)
